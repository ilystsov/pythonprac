DESCRIPTION
       man  is  the  system's  manual pager.  Each page argument
       given to man is normally the name of a  program,  utility
       or  function.   The  manual  page associated with each of
       these arguments is then found and displayed.  A  section,
       if provided, will direct man to look only in that section
       of the manual.  The default action is to search in all of
       the available sections following a pre-defined order (see
       DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found, even if
       page exists in several sections.
